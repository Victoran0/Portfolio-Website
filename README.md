# Portfolio-Website

## A simple Portfolio website made with bootstrap.
### TO install the dependencies

### `npm install`

### To run

### `npm run compile:sass`

#### Sending emails in the contact form was made possible with SMTP JS, you can easily go to `smtpjs.com` and set up your secure token to use also, also make sure the sending from and to is the same email, if not, you might have issues with sending the mail. Since the email is sent by smtp itself, the from would not matter, include the sender's email in the body of the message.

#### Lot of commented sections in the code, you can uncomment and add the section if you want it on your own portfolio website. Just enjoy as you test and learn from the codes...
